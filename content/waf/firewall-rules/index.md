# Firewall rules

Firewall rules allow users to create rules that inspect incoming traffic and block, challenge, log, or allow specific requests.

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Deprecation notice">}}
Firewall rules have been deprecated. Cloudflare moved your firewall rules to [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/). For more information on this change, refer to the [Support KB](#).
